# my first project
#Connect your local repo to GitHub  copy the link from github then in gitbash run the following command
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/shreya02042004/git.git

#git installation and set up
Commands I used:
git --version
git config --global user.name "shreya02042004"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
git config --list
✔️ Confirmed that Git was installed and user details were configured correctly.
